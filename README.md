LWIG Kernel Fork

# Why did I fork this?
Because the internet can feel like a jungle at times - Bonzi
No for real, Because it is pretty hard to find the original LWIG Kernel, it is not on github AFAIK.

https://code.google.com/archive/p/lwig/downloads is the official website, if you want to download it there instead.

# So, how do I use this?
Run IMDISK and then buildpath.bat.
